everwatch
=========

Script to integrate [Marked.app](http://markedapp.com) and [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com).

Modded from original script by [Brett Terpstra](http://brettterpstra.com/2011/11/14/marked-scripts-nvalt-evernote-marsedit-scrivener/) which is included in the [Marked Bonus Pack](http://support.markedapp.com/kb/how-to-tips-and-tricks/marked-bonus-pack-scripts-commands-and-bundles).

Updated to handle the way Evernote currently handles files (2013) and quick launch of Marked.app.

##Usage

Edit the account name in the script. It uses this to find your saved notes on your files system. Doubled check with the file path in the script to make sure your account name is the one the Evernote app is using.

    bash> ./everwatch.rb
